The Visor has been designed to comply with a standard 3-hole punch (4.25” spacing between holes), meaning you can 3-hole punch any clear plastic material and it will fit on the visor.

The Visor has been designed to also work on maker-level printers with PLA and no support removal required.

The fastener for the back of the Visor is a standard #33 rubber-band, however you should be able to use a zip tie, suture or other types of string to fasten the backend as needed.
