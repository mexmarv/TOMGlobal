VentCore is an open source ventilator project designed and developed by Formon in Prishtina, Kosovo.

The shortage of ventilators that the hospitals worldwide are facing has become a big issue in our fight with COVID-19. That is why we developed VentCore.

The purpose of this ventilator is automate the operation of BVM (bag-valve-mask) in a simple, inexpensive and controllable way, for emergency cases.

It is designed as an open system that can be easily produced and replicated fast, at the same time inviting everyone to contribute in its improvement as a device.
